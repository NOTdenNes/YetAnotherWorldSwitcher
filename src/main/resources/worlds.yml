#world:
#alias: world         (Name of the world shown as the itemname within the worldswitching-menu. Colorcodes are permitted. Overwrites default value of 'lobby x'. It is suggested to just use this if 'PlaceWorldsInMenu' is set to 'manually')
#itemOverwrite: diamond_ore (Overwrites the default item set in the config.yml. Leave empty if you want to display the default item set in 'AvailableLobbyItem')
#slotOverwrite: 10          (Overwrites the slot if 'PlaceWorldsInMenu' is set to 'manually'. Valid slot-ids go from 9 to 44: https://wiki.vg/File:DoubleChest-slots.png)
